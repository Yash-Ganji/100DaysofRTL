# 1011 sequence detector
### Mealy type state machine is used
### Sequence is detected in non overlaping condition.
#### A 3 always block FSM design technique is used 
##### Where 2 sequential always blocks are used to determine the output and update the state of FSM. And another combinational always block is used to determine the next state based on current state and input.
